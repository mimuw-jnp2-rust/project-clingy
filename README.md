## Description
Clingy is a simple linker that takes the ELF object files and creates ELF
executable.

I will use material covered in [this book](https://en.1lib.pl/book/2705753/494de3)
and maybe some other tutorials (I will add them here as a reference).

## Functionality
- Takes several object files and creates an executable file (does the whole
  symbol resolution and relocation thing, etc.).
- Works only on `x86_64` Linux.

Right now it's hard for me to estimate how complex the project implementing
these functionalities will turn out to be (I'm still learning about linkers).

If that's not enough, I'll add something.
