## Description
Clingy is a simple linker that takes the ELF object files and creates ELF
executable.

## Roadmap

####  03.06.2022
 * 1k SLOC reached. Still not enough to show minimal working example.

#### 10.06.2022 (late date because of other projects and homework assignments)
 * Minimal working example: linking simple object files without shared
   dependencies, generated by NASM and GCC, into a static executable. Files are
   processed in parallel wherever possible.

#### 17.06.2022
 * All TODOs fixed. Error reporting improved. Refactoring so that the code looks
   nicer and is more idiomatic.
 * Tests.

#### 24.06.2022
 * Merging .symtabs from different files into one .symtab. (Binaries generated
   by clingy are stripped right now: we are not outputing .symtab. That has to
   be changed).

#### Probably can't make it by the end of the semester (but I plan to continue after the course;))
 * Support for static library archives (.a) and libc.
 * Generating .GOT and .PLT, linking with shared libraries, PIE support.
 * Slowly moving to a feature-complete linker: support for things like handling
   COMDAT sections for example.
 * Feature-complete linker: ability to link Chromium. Full-fledged support for
   linking scripts. More architectures. Simple LTOs like Mark&Sweep from entry
   symbol to remove unused sections.
